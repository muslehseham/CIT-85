<!--ABOUT US-->
<section class="s1">
    <h1>WHO ARE WE?</h1>
    <p class="p1">Just an amateur, everyday person who occasionally tries to bake on a whim. <br>
        Which means that we never seem to have the ingredients, nor the tools, that our recipies require - so we always have to go shopping in order to stock up our necessities to get our cravings satisfied. Thus the name 'The Unprepared Chef,' was born.  </p>

    <h1>MILLE CREPE CAKE</h1>
    <h2 class="h2">Ingredients</h2>
    <p class="p1">CREPES <br>
        6 tablespoons butter<br>
        3 cups milk<br>
        6 eggs<br>
        1 ½ cups flour<br>
        ⅔ cup cocoa powder<br>
        7 tablespoons sugar<br>
        4 cups whipped cream<br>
        <br>
        GANACHE<br>
        1 cup heavy cream<br>
        4 tablespoons sugar<br>
        6 oz chocolate<br>
        1 tablespoon butter<br>
        ¼ cup powdered sugar, optional for topping</p>
    <h2 class="h2">Preparation</h2>
    <p class="p2">Make the crepes by melting the butter and allowing it to brown slightly. Set aside. <br>
        In the same pot, warm the milk. Remove from heat. <br>
        In a bowl, whisk flour, cocoa powder, and sugar. Mix in eggs.<br>
        Gradually mix in butter and warm milk. Chill.<br>
        On a nonstick skillet over medium heat, pour ¼ cup (60 ml) of crepe batter, and tip the pan to cover the entire bottom surface. Cook until bottom surface of crepe begins to brown, then flip.<br>
        Cool crepe. Repeat until all of the crepe batter is used.<br>
        Stack crepes on top of each other, with whipped cream between each layer. Once assembled, trim edges for a cleaner look, if desired.<br>
        For the ganache, bring the heavy cream and sugar to a boil, and pour over chocolate and butter. Let cool.<br>
        Spread over the crepe cake.<br>
        Top with sifted powdered sugar (optional).<br>
        Enjoy!</p>

    <h1>BISCOFF LOTUS NO-BAKE CAKE</h1>
    <h2 class="h2">Ingredients</h2>
    <p class="p1">
        1 jar of Biscoff Lotus Cookie Butter <br>
        2 packets of Biscoff Lotus cookies <br>
        2 12oz tubs of cool whip
        2 tbsp Nescafe with 2 cups of hot water
    </p>
    <h2 class="h2">Preparation</h2>
    <p class="p2">Dip the lotus cookie into the Nescafe then place it in a 9 by 13 pan. Keep repeating this step until there is a flat layer of dipped lotus cookies.
        <br>
        Top that off with the cool whip and spread evenly. <br>
        Add another layer of the Nescafe dipped lotus cookies. Then top off with another layer of the cream. <br>
        Smooth this very well. <br>
        Place in the freezer for 30 minutes. <br>
        Once out of the freezer, melt half a jar of biscoff in a microwave-safe bowl. Pour on top of the lotus cake and spread it out quickly before it cools and evenly.
        <br>
        Crumble a few lotus cookies and scatter the crumbs around the edges and corners of the pan. <br>
    Enjoy!</p>

    <h1>OREO TRUFFLES</h1>
    <h2 class="h2">Ingredients</h2>
    <p class="p1">36 chocolate sandwich cookies <br>
        8 oz cream cheese, softened <br>
        12 oz white chocolate, melted</p>
    <h2 class="h2">Preparation</h2>
    <p class="p2">In a food processor, finely crush the cookies, reserving about 2 tablespoons of the mixture for sprinkling on top of the truffles.
        <br>
        In a large bowl, combine the cookie crumbs and cream cheese, stirring until evenly mixed. Chill the mixture for about an hour or until it can be rolled into a ball and hold its shape.
        <br>
        Divide and roll the mixture into golf ball-sized balls. Dip the truffles in the melted white chocolate and place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Sprinkle the reserved cookie crumbs on top of the truffles before the chocolate hardens.
        <br>
        Enjoy!</p>
